# LaraQuiz
Laravel package to create forms: surveys, exams, etc.

## System requirements
* PHP >= 7.1

## Installation
Require this package with composer. Laravel 5.5 uses Package Auto-Discovery, so doesn't require you to manually add the 
ServiceProvider.

## Usage
Package contains database migrations and models that are perfectly suited to create any form you want. Feel free to use
built-in routes and controllers or extend them. Blade views for administration panel are also included, use they as an
example to create your own views.
